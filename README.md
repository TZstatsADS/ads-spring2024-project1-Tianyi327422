### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)

This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester.

Term: Spring 2024

-   Projec title: What Makes Women Happy

-   This project is conducted by Tianyi Jiang

-   Project summary: Incorporating the cleaned_hm.csv and demographic.csv files from the HappyDB dataset, this project delves into the impact of marital status and age on women's happiness. By meticulously processing the textual data in cleaned_hm.csv and integrating it with demographic information from demographic.csv, this study reveals how marital status and age influence women's happiness on various levels. The analysis primarily focuses on these two dimensions - marital status and age - to explore their specific effects on women's happiness, deliberately avoiding other variables such as career achievements or social relationships. Utilizing an interactive analysis platform through the R Shiny application, the project enables users to deeply understand the key factors affecting women's happiness based on marital status and age.

-   Three questions will be answered in this report are:

    1.  Does Marriage Bring Happiness to Women？
    2.  What kinds of happiness experiences do friends and boyfriends bring to single women?
    3.  Are Happiness Factors Similar for Women of Different Age Groups？
